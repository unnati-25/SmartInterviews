Question 1, I created createcounter function which returns a seperate count for each individual. This says about the concept of closure.
Question 2, I used a for loop with setTimeout to display 'Hi {name}' in every 1sec(1000ms). This is closure inside loops.
Question 3,
  Part 1, this explains hoisting with let, which demonstrates how accessing 'let' before declaration gives an error.
  Part 2, this says about the significance of this, how this behaves in normal functions and how the arrow function provides a solution.
  Part 3, describes aboout the closure, similar to as question1, where inner function retains access to variables from outer scope.
  Part 4, uses rest parameter as an argument in the flexiblefunction, to accept flexible number of arguments.
